Database Setup: An SQLite database is created to store BMI records. Each record includes a unique ID, user name, weight, height, BMI, category, and date of record.
BMI Calculation and Categorization: Functions to calculate BMI and categorize it based on standard ranges.
Data Storage: BMI data is saved into the SQLite database.
Historical Data Visualization: Historical BMI data for a user is fetched from the database and displayed using Matplotlib.
GUI Design: Tkinter is used to create the graphical user interface, which includes input fields, buttons, and labels.

Customization:

Extend the data visualization to include more detailed statistics.
Improve the GUI design for better user experience.
Add additional error handling and input validation for robustness.
Allow users to delete or update records in the database.
